# Employee Turnover Data Analysis and Tree-based Prediction Models
In this capstone project, I used python and libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit learn, matplotlib, and seaborn to clean and perform exploratory data analysis on the provided employee survey dataset. Potential reasons for employee turnover were uncovered, and Random Forest and XGBoost models were created to predict if an employee left the company based on their survey results. The models were then tuned with GridSearchCV, evaluated, and then compared to decide which was stronger. I then came up with recommendations based on the results of the analysis and performance of the models.
